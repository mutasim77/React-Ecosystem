Hello and welcome 👋 to ReactGalaxy✨! Your presence here indicates your keen interest in React, and I'm right there with you as a dedicated fan of ReactJS. 🚀 This website was born from my desire to create a comprehensive hub that encompasses the entire React ecosystem.

I understand that not every library or framework on this website is the trendiest topic at the moment, but gathering them all in one place is still a valuable resource. 💎 My inspiration for this project comes from the <a href="https://dev.to/avinashvagh/react-ecosystem-in-2024-418k">this article</a> and <a href="https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react">this repo.</a> 🦋

I'm all about community and collaboration, so I'd love for you to contribute by suggesting new React-related stuff or improving what's already here. Your ideas and input are always welcome! 🙌

## Update
Migrated to Svelte because apparently I enjoy having websites that actually load before the heat death of the universe. Turns out you don't need 500MB of node_modules and a quantum computer to display a few links. Who knew?!
![node modules](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=1280,height=720,fit=cover,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fthepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fi%2F9i6bs4g6cx05jeagfhum.png)

Check out these numbers (they don't lie):
```
Next.js build: 158 KB of JavaScript (First Load)
Svelte build: 34 KB TOTAL

Next.js just for shared stuff: 87.6 KB
Svelte: "What's a chunk? Never heard of it."
```

My entire Svelte app is literally smaller than just the basic parts of Next.js! 
And the best part? Zero external dependencies! No more waiting 5 minutes for node_modules to download the entire internet.

Of course I'll host this beauty on GitHub Pages because why pay for hosting when your app is lighter than a PDF of a restaurant menu? 🤷‍♂️ Sometimes the simple solution is the best solution!

Happy coding! ❤️
